Peppy
=====

This is a very silly project. You probably don't actually want anything from
it. My only excuse is that I was drunk, slightly bored, and had all the pieces
to hand anyway.

Peppy is a tiny fuzzer I extracted and improved from my fuzzer for yapf.

All it does is to try to find examples of each pep8 checker warning and error
category.

This repository contains it, some associated tooling, and a corpus of examples
it has extracted.

You might find the corpus of generated examples interesting, but they're a bit
silly too.

Licensing
---------

Peppy is MPL v2 because that's my default license these days.

I have literally no idea what the legal status of the examples is. They're
digested from a wide collection of open source code, but I don't know if they
constitute a derived work. Also you'd be hard pressed to figure out *what*
open source code they come from.
